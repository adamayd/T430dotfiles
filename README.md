# .T460dotfiles
Originally thought to be dotfiles for only a single model computer, as I learn it may be for desktops and another for test servers.  At this point I don't know.  Hopefully in the future this repo will contain .dotfiles as well as rule files and installation scripts and stream lined instructions all in effort to make nuke and paves as seamless as possible.  Currently included are:
* Lenovo Thinkpad T460 Arch Linux Installation Instructions
